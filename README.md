# ScreentimeLimit
a chrome extension to limit my screen time on certain websites as I wish

This chrome extension forbids access to Instagram reels and YouTube shorts

it forbids acess to instagram and youtube from 23:00 to 2:00 local time 

it only permits 5 minutes of Youtube and Instagram over the past 30 rolling minutes
